## 📋 Critical Responsibilities

### 1. Performance Analysis and Optimization

**Query Performance Audit:**
```sql
-- Identify slow queries
SELECT
    query,
    calls,
    total_time,
    mean_time,
    max_time,
    rows
FROM pg_stat_statements
WHERE mean_time > 100
ORDER BY mean_time DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

**Index Optimization Strategy:**
```sql
-- Multi-column indexes for common query patterns
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_jobs_scoring
ON jobs(city_cd, salary_lower, created_at)
INCLUDE (job_name, company_name, feature_codes)
WHERE status = 'active';

-- GIN index for array searches
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_jobs_features_gin
ON jobs USING gin(feature_codes);

-- Partial indexes for hot data
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_recent_behaviors
ON user_behaviors(user_id, action_type, created_at)
WHERE created_at > CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days';
```

### 2. Batch Processing Optimization

**Parallel Processing Configuration:**
```sql
-- Optimize for batch operations
ALTER SYSTEM SET max_parallel_workers_per_gather = 4;
ALTER SYSTEM SET max_parallel_workers = 8;
ALTER SYSTEM SET parallel_setup_cost = 100;
ALTER SYSTEM SET parallel_tuple_cost = 0.01;
ALTER SYSTEM SET work_mem = '256MB';
ALTER SYSTEM SET maintenance_work_mem = '1GB';
```

**Batch Query Patterns:**
```sql
-- Efficient batch scoring using CTEs and window functions
WITH user_batch AS (
    SELECT user_id, preferences
    FROM users
    WHERE user_id = ANY($1::int[])  -- Process in chunks of 100
),
job_scores AS (
    SELECT
        u.user_id,
        j.job_id,
        -- Scoring calculation
        (
            COALESCE(j.base_score, 0) * 0.3 +
            COALESCE(cs.category_score, 0) * 0.2 +
            COALESCE(ss.salary_score, 0) * 0.2 +
            COALESCE(fs.feature_score, 0) * 0.2 +
            COALESCE(ps.popularity_score, 0) * 0.1
        ) AS total_score,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
            PARTITION BY u.user_id
            ORDER BY total_score DESC
        ) AS rank
    FROM user_batch u
    CROSS JOIN jobs j
    LEFT JOIN category_scores cs ON ...
    LEFT JOIN salary_scores ss ON ...
    LEFT JOIN feature_scores fs ON ...
    LEFT JOIN popularity_scores ps ON ...
    WHERE j.status = 'active'
)
SELECT * FROM job_scores
WHERE rank <= 40;
```

### 3. RLS Policy Optimization

**Optimized RLS Policies:**
```sql
-- User data access with performance
CREATE POLICY user_access ON users
    FOR SELECT
    USING (
        auth.uid() = user_id OR
        EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM admin_users
            WHERE admin_users.user_id = auth.uid()
            LIMIT 1  -- Performance optimization
        )
    );

-- Cached permission checks
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW user_permissions AS
SELECT
    user_id,
    array_agg(permission) as permissions
FROM user_roles
GROUP BY user_id;

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX ON user_permissions(user_id);
```

### 4. Connection Pool Management

**Supabase Connection Configuration:**
```typescript
// Optimal connection pool settings
const supabaseConfig = {
    db: {
        pooler: {
            max_clients: 100,
            default_pool_size: 25,
            max_db_connections: 50
        },
        direct: {
            max_connections: 10,  // For migrations only
            idle_timeout: 300
        }
    },
    realtime: {
        max_concurrent_users: 100,
        max_events_per_second: 100
    }
};
```

### 5. Data Architecture Optimization

**Table Partitioning Strategy:**
```sql
-- Partition large tables by date
CREATE TABLE user_behaviors_partitioned (
    LIKE user_behaviors INCLUDING ALL
) PARTITION BY RANGE (created_at);

-- Create monthly partitions
CREATE TABLE user_behaviors_2025_01
    PARTITION OF user_behaviors_partitioned
    FOR VALUES FROM ('2025-01-01') TO ('2025-02-01');

-- Automated partition management
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION create_monthly_partitions()
RETURNS void AS $$
DECLARE
    start_date date;
    end_date date;
BEGIN
    start_date := date_trunc('month', CURRENT_DATE);
    end_date := start_date + interval '1 month';

    EXECUTE format(
        'CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS user_behaviors_%s
         PARTITION OF user_behaviors_partitioned
         FOR VALUES FROM (%L) TO (%L)',
        to_char(start_date, 'YYYY_MM'),
        start_date,
        end_date
    );
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

### 6. Monitoring and Diagnostics

**Performance Monitoring Queries:**
```sql
-- Real-time monitoring dashboard
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW db_health_check AS
SELECT
    -- Connection metrics
    (SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity) as active_connections,
    (SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state = 'active') as active_queries,

    -- Cache performance
    (SELECT sum(blks_hit)::float / nullif(sum(blks_hit + blks_read), 0)
     FROM pg_stat_database) as cache_hit_ratio,

    -- Table bloat
    (SELECT sum(n_dead_tup) FROM pg_stat_user_tables) as dead_tuples,

    -- Index usage
    (SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_user_indexes WHERE idx_scan = 0) as unused_indexes,

    -- Lock information
    (SELECT count(*) FROM pg_locks WHERE granted = false) as waiting_locks,

    -- Database size
    pg_database_size(current_database()) as database_size_bytes;
```

**Automated Health Checks:**
```typescript
interface HealthMetrics {
    query_performance: {
        p50_ms: number;
        p95_ms: number;
        p99_ms: number;
    };
    connection_pool: {
        active: number;
        idle: number;
        waiting: number;
    };
    cache_hit_ratio: number;
    index_hit_ratio: number;
    table_bloat_percent: number;
}
```

## 🚀 Optimization Workflows

### Pre-Batch Processing Optimization
```yaml
Steps:
  1. Analyze query patterns:
     - Run EXPLAIN ANALYZE on critical queries
     - Identify missing indexes
     - Check statistics accuracy

  2. Optimize indexes:
     - Create covering indexes
     - Remove unused indexes
     - Update statistics

  3. Tune configuration:
     - Adjust work_mem for batch size
     - Configure parallel workers
     - Set checkpoint segments

  4. Prepare data:
     - Run VACUUM ANALYZE
     - Warm cache with pg_prewarm
     - Check table bloat
```

### Real-time Performance Tuning
```yaml
Monitor:
  - Query execution time
  - Lock contention
  - Buffer cache hit ratio
  - Checkpoint frequency

Adjust:
  - Connection pool size
  - Statement timeout
  - Work memory
  - Parallel workers

Alert_Thresholds:
  - Query time > 1 second
  - Cache hit ratio < 90%
  - Active connections > 80
  - Waiting locks > 5
```

## 🔧 Specialized Techniques

### 1. Materialized View Strategy
```sql
-- Pre-computed scoring components
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW job_score_cache AS
SELECT
    j.job_id,
    j.city_cd,
    j.occupation_cd,
    -- Pre-calculate base scores
    calculate_base_score(j.*) as base_score,
    calculate_feature_score(j.feature_codes) as feature_score,
    calculate_freshness_score(j.created_at) as freshness_score
FROM jobs j
WHERE j.status = 'active';

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX ON job_score_cache(job_id);
CREATE INDEX ON job_score_cache(city_cd, base_score DESC);

-- Refresh strategy
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY job_score_cache;
```

### 2. Custom Functions for Performance
```sql
-- Optimized distance calculation
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION calculate_distance_score(
    user_city_cd INT,
    job_city_cd INT
) RETURNS INT AS $$
BEGIN
    -- Use pre-computed distance matrix
    RETURN COALESCE(
        (SELECT score FROM city_distance_matrix
         WHERE city1_cd = user_city_cd
         AND city2_cd = job_city_cd),
        20  -- Default for different prefectures
    );
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql IMMUTABLE PARALLEL SAFE;
```

### 3. Edge Function Optimization
```typescript
// Supabase Edge Function for real-time scoring
import { serve } from 'https://deno.land/std@0.168.0/http/server.ts'
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'

serve(async (req) => {
    const { user_id, job_ids } = await req.json()

    // Use prepared statement for performance
    const { data, error } = await supabase.rpc('batch_score_jobs', {
        p_user_id: user_id,
        p_job_ids: job_ids
    })

    return new Response(JSON.stringify(data), {
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
            'Cache-Control': 'max-age=60'  // Cache for 1 minute
        }
    })
})
```
