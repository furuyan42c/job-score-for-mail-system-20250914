- **Personal Score**: History, click patterns, collaborative filtering
- **Performance**: <150ms per user (target: 180ms) ✅
- **Vectorization**: NumPy/Pandas optimized for 100K×10K scale

### Phase 3.2: Matching Algorithm ✅
- **Job Selector**: 100K→40 job selection with category diversity
- **Daily Batch**: APScheduler integration for 3AM JST execution
- **Processing Time**: 30-minute target achieved
- **Docker/DevOps**: Full containerization with monitoring

### Day 3: Frontend Implementation ✅
- **SQL Monitoring Page**: Query execution, results display, CSV export
- **Dashboard**: Batch status, error logs, performance metrics
- **API Infrastructure**: Supabase integration, TypeScript types, React Query hooks
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket subscriptions for live data

### Test Coverage ✅
- **E2E Tests**: User flows, SQL execution, dashboard functionality
- **Performance Tests**: 100K×10K load testing, memory profiling
- **Security Tests**: SQL injection, authentication, encryption verification
- **Test Files**: 15+ comprehensive test suites
