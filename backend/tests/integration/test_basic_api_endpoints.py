T080: Basic API Endpoint Tests [RED PHASE]

This test is intentionally designed to fail (TDD RED phase).
Documents that the following API endpoints are not yet implemented,
making the need for implementation clear.

Test targets:
- Health Check: GET /health
- Jobs API: GET /api/v1/jobs
- Users API: POST /api/v1/users/register

Run command: pytest tests/integration/test_basic_api_endpoints.py -v
