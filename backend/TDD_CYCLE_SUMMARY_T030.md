- Status tracking and updates
- Basic error handling
- Minimal metrics collection

**Result**: ✅ Tests transitioned from failing to passing with minimal implementation

## ⚙️ REFACTOR Phase: Advanced Implementation ✅ COMPLETED

**Objective**: Improve code quality, remove hardcoding, add production-ready features

### 1. Enhanced Architecture

**Enumerations for Type Safety**:
```python
class JobStatus(Enum):
    PENDING = "pending"
    RUNNING = "running"
    COMPLETED = "completed"
    FAILED = "failed"
    PAUSED = "paused"
    RETRY_SCHEDULED = "retry_scheduled"
    TIMEOUT = "timeout"
    MISFIRED = "misfired"
    CANCELLED = "cancelled"

class JobPriority(Enum):
    LOW = 1
    NORMAL = 5
    HIGH = 10
    CRITICAL = 15
```

**Advanced Configuration Classes**:
```python
@dataclass
class NotificationConfig:
    on_success: List[str]
    on_failure: List[str]
    on_timeout: List[str]
    on_retry: List[str]
    webhook_url: Optional[str]
    slack_channel: Optional[str]

@dataclass
class ResourceLimits:
    memory_mb: Optional[int]
    cpu_percent: Optional[float]
    timeout_seconds: Optional[int]
    max_instances: int = 1
```

### 2. Batch Service Integration

**Integrated with existing batch services**:
- **T027 Data Import**: `DataImportBatch` integration for CSV processing
- **T028 Scoring**: `ScoringBatch` integration for user-job scoring
- **T029 Matching**: `MatchingBatch` integration for recommendation generation

**Service-Specific Execution**:
```python
async def _execute_batch_service(self, job_id: str, job_config: JobConfig):
    service_type = self._get_service_type_from_function(job_config.function)

    if service_type == 'data_import':
        return await self._execute_data_import(job_id, job_config)
    elif service_type == 'scoring':
        return await self._execute_scoring(job_id, job_config)
    elif service_type == 'matching':
        return await self._execute_matching(job_id, job_config)
```

### 3. Advanced Scheduling Features

**Priority Queue System**:
- Jobs can be assigned priority levels (LOW, NORMAL, HIGH, CRITICAL)
- `execute_by_priority()` method for priority-based execution
- Automatic priority conversion from legacy integer values

**Cron-like Scheduling**:
- Full APScheduler integration with cron, interval, and date triggers
- Advanced trigger configuration through `trigger_args`
- Support for complex scheduling patterns

**Job Dependencies**:
- Dependency chain management (import → scoring → matching)
- `wait_for_dependencies()` with automatic blocking
- Dependency validation before job execution

### 4. Comprehensive Error Handling

**Multi-Level Retry Logic**:
```python
async def handle_job_error(self, job_id: str, error: Exception, attempt: int):
    # Exponential backoff retry calculation
    delay_seconds = self._calculate_retry_delay(attempt, retry_config)

    # Job-specific retry configuration
    if await self.should_retry_job(job_id, attempt):
        await self.schedule_job_retry(job_id, delay_seconds)
```

**Error Categories**:
- Transient errors → Automatic retry with backoff
- Timeout errors → Resource cleanup and notification
- Dependency errors → Wait and retry mechanism
- Critical errors → Immediate failure with alerting

### 5. Performance Monitoring

**Comprehensive Metrics Collection**:
```python
metrics = {
    'scheduler_info': {uptime, timezone, max_concurrent_jobs},
    'job_counts': {total, running, completed, failed, paused},
    'execution_metrics': {success_rate, avg_execution_time, total_time},
    'resource_usage': {memory_mb, cpu_percent, peaks},
    'health_status': {status, running_jobs, stuck_jobs, error_rate}
}
```

**Resource Monitoring**:
- Real-time memory and CPU usage tracking
- Resource limit enforcement per job
- Peak usage tracking for optimization
- Automatic resource limit violations detection

### 6. Health Monitoring System

**Automated Health Checks**:
- Background health monitoring loop
- Stuck job detection (running > 1 hour)
- Error rate monitoring and alerting
- Automatic corrective actions

**Health Issues Handling**:
- Stuck job cancellation
- High error rate mitigation
- Resource exhaustion detection
- Scheduler state validation

### 7. Notification System

**Multi-Channel Notifications**:
- Email notifications for job events
- Webhook integration for external systems
- Slack channel notifications
- Event-specific recipient configuration

**Notification Events**:
- Job success/failure/timeout
- Retry attempts and final failures
- Health status changes
- Resource limit violations

### 8. Configuration Management

**Backup and Restore**:
```python
backup_data = {
    'timestamp': datetime.now().isoformat(),
    'scheduler_config': asdict(self.config),
    'job_configs': {job_id: asdict(config) for job_id, config in self._job_configs.items()},
    'job_statuses': {job_id: status.value for job_id, status in self._job_statuses.items()},
    'execution_info': self._execution_info,
    'metrics': self._metrics,
    'job_history': self._job_history
}
```

**Persistence Features**:
- Automatic configuration backups
- Job state persistence to database
- Recovery from system restarts

- Dynamic job modification (trigger, function, priority)
- Job pause/resume functionality
- Graceful job cancellation
- Job removal with cleanup

**Concurrency Control**:
- Configurable concurrent job limits
- Resource-aware job scheduling
- Job coalescing for duplicate executions
- Misfire handling for delayed jobs
